            <p>
                <h3>
                    2.1 The ongoing use of IT tools
                </h3>
                Visual studio code – VS code was very useful thanks to its supply of third party plugins. ‘Emmet’ was useful in generating HTML and CSS syntax quickly and correctly meaning there was less debugging. ‘Live Server’ allowed me to view changes I made to my website instantly in the browser which allowed the project to move faster. Dissatisfied with the named colours available in CSS I sought to include a customised colour scheme, aiding in this was ‘VS Color’ which provided a pop up colour picker whenever I entered a hash to begin a hex triplet. 
                Draw.io allowed me to create a visible style to my website for me to work towards resulting in a visibly appealing website
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>
                    2.2 Appropriate selection of IT tools
                </h3>
                VS Code was an appropriate tool for building a website thanks to its plug-ins and workspace management. Trello was important in providing a visual representation of my Kanban project management of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>
                    2.3 Strengths and Weaknesses of the final project
                </h3>
                The website turned out very similar to my original wireframe design. It has a navigation bar and a side bar. I managed to import a google font called ‘Poppins’ to use instead of the default sans serif fonts which gave the website a more modern look. Due to my use of viewport metrics, the website looks very similar on different screen sizes as well as different browsers.
                The website could perhaps have benefitted from multiple fonts, especially when it came to ‘a’ tags, as the article links and navigation bar options look exactly the same. The website does not handle zooming in and out as well as I would have liked; due to the use of viewport metrics the website container does not adjust to the zoom level of the browser and instead only the text of the website changes size.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>
                    2.4 Further improvements to the project
                </h3>
                I would attempt to add CSS border styling to sections of the page and fix the zoom issue. I might also explore accessibility of the website as users without the use of a cursor would be unable to navigate my page with ease. I might also attempt more styling of the quotes in the bottom right and perhaps even utilise a third party CSS framework like bootstrap.
            </p>

                    2.5 A review of outcomes
                </h3>
                This website fulfills client requirements of a multi-page site that includes various html tags like lists, address tags, headers, images, and paragraphs. The page is styled through a CSS document that includes CSS3 components such as flex-box as well as font styling, font decoration, and utilisation of the box model in the form of margins and padding.
